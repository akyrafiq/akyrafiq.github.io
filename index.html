      <p class="subheader"><strong>About Me:</strong><br /> Thasnks for visiting. I am Akmal. I am a data scientist working in a bank but I like to get involved in a wide variety of other little projects here and there so put this together to showcase them.</p>
      <strong>Some projects I am working on:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>Optimal Resource Allocations <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> I am currently working with Professor Reimer Kuhn on a range of problems about optimal resource allocation in large scale processing networks. We are expanding on some work he began a few years ago, which I then expanded upon in my Master's Dissertation, where I got a Distinction and we have continued our work since I left KCL with an aim of producing a scientific paper which extends into applications in Industrial Economics. Work is currently on hold due to coronavirus. You can read my Masters Thesis <a href="./thesis.pdf">here</a></span></li>
        <li>Teaching <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> In my spare time, I wort KCL on a part time basis, working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the following modules:
          <ul>
            <li>Linear Algebra and Geometry</li>
            <li>Calculus</li>
            <li>Elements of Statistical Learning</li>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="./ESLNOTES.pdf">Here are some short notes I created for my class.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Mathematical Biology</li>
            <li>Probability and Statistics II</li>
            <li>Statistics for Data Analysis</li>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="./datavizR.html">Here is a short primer for Data Visualisation in R I made for my class.</a></li>
            </ul>
          </ul></span></li>
        <li>Forsa <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> In my spare time, I am working as a backend developer on a start up called Forsa. The aim is to make education opportunites easier to access for those wishing to learn new skills later into their career.</span></li>
        <li>Going Beyond Wolverhampton <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> I have been offered the chance to host a Radio show at a local Radio Station called Going Beyond Wolverhampton. This is a show being hosted by myself, where I will be interviewing people from all walks of life (From Wolverhampton and Beyond) and gain an insight on their life experiences. We will be looking to provide advice and inspiration for others. You can catch the show during Ramadan at Tuesday 2-3pm every week on Radio, Facebook, YouTube and the Ramadan Radio Wolverhampton App.</span></li>
        <li>Data Visualisations <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> A regular project I set up for myself during this year where I look to visualise random things I find interesting. Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/akyrafiq/data_viz_new">repo</a>. This is test <a href="./heatmap.html">link to see if I can link to the webpage from here</a>.</span></li>
       <!-- <li>Random Ruminations <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> A multimedia project I have been working on with my friend. We aim to launch at some point in the future...</span></li>-->
      </ul>
      <p class="subheader"><strong>Previous research experience:</strong></p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>UK Terror Threat Level <br /> <span style="color: gray;">In 2017, I took part in the LSE GROUPS scheme- a programme which brought together undergraduate students of a wide range of disciplines to work together on a research project. I collaborated with a team of student researchers to produce a paper about public perceptions of the UK&rsquo;s Terror Threat Level System. We found the system to be ineffective due to the vague language. You can find our findings <a href="./uncertainty.pdf">here</a>.</span></li>
        <li>Son Preference <br /> <span style="color: gray;">In 1990, Amartya Sen wrote an essay about the phenomenon of "missing women", highlighting uneven gender ratios around tjhe world. In the years since, there has been a lot of work into the area of gender inequality, particularly in traditionally patriarchal societies. I took part in a project at LSE trying to compile all this research into a centralised location. <a href="./son.pdf">Here</a> is a sample of one of the summaries.</span></li>
        <!-- <li>Sports Player Transfer Market <br /> <span style="color: gray;">.</span></li> --> 
      </ul>
      <p class="subheader"><strong>What else I do in my spare time:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can see me attempting to be a photographer over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aksra97/">here</a></li>
        <li>I used to volunteer at the Children of Adam soup kitchen fairly regularly before the current pandemic. Just Â£3 is enough to feed one person, so feel free to donate <a href="https://childrenofadam.org.uk/get-involved/">here<a>.</li>
