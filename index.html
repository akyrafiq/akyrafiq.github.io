      <p class="subheader"><strong>About Me</strong><br /> I am Akmal. I am data scientist working in a media agency but I like to get involved in a wide variety of other little projects here and there.</p>
      <strong>Some projects I am working on</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>Optimal Resource Allocations <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> I am currently working with Reimer Kuhn on a range of problems abourt resource allocation in large scale processing networks. Work began in my Master, where I got a Distinction on my masters Thesis and we have continued our work since I left KCL. Work is currently on hold due to coronavirus.</span></li>
        <li>Newtech International <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> I am helping out as a backend developer with these guys on a very cool start up. Currently getting to grips with the vast world of AWS.</span></li>
        <li>Random Ruminations <br /> <span style="color: gray;"> A multimedia blog I have been working on with my friend Adnan where we aim to make a wide range of broad academic issues accessible to a wider audience. Follow our Twitter for the latest updates and our Substack for the articles we are writing.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subheader"><strong>Past projects I have worked on</strong></p>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>UK Terror Threat Level <br /> <span style="color: gray;">In 2017, I took part in the LSE GROUPS scheme- a programme which brought together undergraduate students of a wide range of disciplines to work together on a research project. I collaborated with a team of student researchers to produce a paper about public perceptions of the UK&rsquo;s Terror Threat Level System. We found the system to be ineffective due to the vague language. You can find our findings here.</span></li>
        <li>Son Preference <br /> <span style="color: gray;">In 1990, Amartya Sen wrote an essay about the phenomenon of "missing women", highlighting uneven gender ratios around tjhe world. In the years since, there has been a lot of work into the area of gender inequality, particularly in traditionally patriarchal societies. I took part in a project at LSE trying to compile all this research into a centrlised locationd. You can find the results over here.</span></li>
